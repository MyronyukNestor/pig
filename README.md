The object of the game is to score 100 points by rolling the dice. A move is a series of throws and consists of the following: the player rolls the dice an unlimited number of times and sums up the values obtained. However, if one is rolled, the entire amount received for the turn is voided and the turn goes to the next player. A player can end his turn at any moment.
